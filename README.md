    source venv/bin/activate # On Windows: .\venv\Scripts\activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root of your backend directory and add necessary environment variables (e.g., database connection strings, API keys).
    ```
    DB_URI=your_database_connection_string
    PORT=5000
    ```
5.  **Run database migrations (if applicable):**

    # or
    node server.js
    
    # Example for Python
    python app.py # or python manage.py runserver
    ```
2.  **Start the frontend development server:**
